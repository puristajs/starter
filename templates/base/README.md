# PURISTA Application

Welcome to your PURISTA based application.

The official documentation can be found at **[purista.dev](https://purista.dev)**.

It is highly recommended to install the PURISTA CLI globally:

```sh
npm i -g @purista/cli
```

This allows to create new entities quickly. In the root of your this project:

- run `purista add service` to add a new service
- run `purista add command` to add a new command to an existing service
- run `purista add subscription` to add a new subscription to an existing service
